# How to Get Unbanned on DayZ (2025 Guide) 🪓

Getting banned from DayZ can feel like getting shot by a fully geared player — sudden and painful. But don’t panic! If you think your ban was a big oopsie, this easy guide will show you how to find out why you got banned and how to appeal like a pro to reclaim your survival adventure.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did you try making a brand new DayZ account only to get banned again faster than you can say “zombie apocalypse”? That’s probably an **HWID ban** (Hardware ID ban)! DayZ tracks your computer’s unique hardware ID, so even if your account changes, your PC might still be blacklisted.

An HWID spoofer can help you cheat the system — legally* — and get back to looting without constantly hitting ban walls.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check your emails, Steam messages, or DayZ notifications for the official “You’re banned” memo. Bans often hit for:
- Cheating, hacks, or using shady third-party software  
- Team killing, griefing, or toxic player behavior  
- Account selling, sharing, or suspicious hacking activity  

**Pro tip:** Skim the DayZ and Steam Terms of Service before firing off your appeal (knowledge is power, friend).

## Step 2: Collect Your Information 📝

Before you go waving your arms at support, grab:
- Your Steam or Bohemia Interactive account email  
- Your DayZ username/ID  
- The exact date you got banhammered  
- Any screenshots, error messages, or ban notices

## Step 3: Submit a Ban Appeal 📧
