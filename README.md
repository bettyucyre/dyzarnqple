<p>Getting banned from DayZ can feel like getting shot by a fully geared player — sudden and painful. But don’t panic! If you think your ban was a big oopsie, this easy guide will show you how to find out why you got banned and how to appeal like a pro to reclaim your survival adventure.</p>
<h2 id="maybe-you-are-hwid-banned-">Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️</h2>
<p>Did you try making a brand new DayZ account only to get banned again faster than you can say “zombie apocalypse”? That’s probably an <strong>HWID ban</strong> (Hardware ID ban)! DayZ tracks your computer’s unique hardware ID, so even if your account changes, your PC might still be blacklisted.</p>

<p>An HWID spoofer can help you cheat the system — legally* — and get back to looting without constantly hitting ban walls.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-understand-why-you-were-banned-">Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓</h2>
<p>Check your emails, Steam messages, or DayZ notifications for the official “You’re banned” memo. Bans often hit for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheating, hacks, or using shady third-party software  </li>
<li>Team killing, griefing, or toxic player behavior  </li>
<li>Account selling, sharing, or suspicious hacking activity  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Skim the DayZ and Steam Terms of Service before firing off your appeal (knowledge is power, friend).</p>

<h2 id="step-2-collect-your-information-">Step 2: Collect Your Information 📝</h2>
<p>Before you go waving your arms at support, grab:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Steam or Bohemia Interactive account email  </li>
<li>Your DayZ username/ID  </li>
<li>The exact date you got banhammered  </li>
<li>Any screenshots, error messages, or ban notices  </li>
</ul>
